Description: The cRisk package represents a convenient way to implement the new methodologies that are the extensions of the existing estimators. It utilizes a non-homogeneous Markov chain for modeling repeat screening     test result and estimating the cumulative risk of multiple false positive results across a recommended program of repeat screening based on some extensions of the existing estimators for cumulative risk of a single false     positive result.
